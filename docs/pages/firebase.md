#### Firebase for PostgreSQL

SQL Joy is perhaps most comparable to Firebase, in that you can query the db without writing
backend code. It allows the full power and flexibility of SQL, as well as third-party API calls,
background jobs, etc that one uses a traditional backend for. Firebase has a proprietary NoSQL db
that's quite limited and locks you in. The trouble with Firebase, speaking
from experience, is that eventually you outgrow it. The limitations eventually catch up with you and you're
forced into elaborate and costly workarounds reinventing things like referential integrity and joins
which you get from SQL databases. SQL Joy lets you use the well known and battle-tested PostgreSQL
database with the ease of Firebase. You shouldn't ever outgrow SQL Joy, but if one day you need to migrate away from it,
it's just JavaScript and PostgreSQL, and you're not locked in.
